INTRODUCTION 
+Bitcoin was the firs one to take blockchain mainstream.
+Bitcoin is like a digital gold.
+Etereum allows for smart contracts.
+Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts.
+Hybrid Smart Contracts combine on-chain and off chain components.


Features of blockchain
+Decentralized
+Transparency and Flexibility
+Speed and Efficiency
+Security and Immutability
+Removal of Counterparty Risk
+Trust minimized agreements

DAOs [Decentralized autonomous organizations]
+The backbone of a DAO is its smart contract. 
+The contract defines the rules of the organisation and holds the group's treasury. 
+Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. 

META MASK
+Create a Meta Mask Wallet.
+Save your wallet Secret Code safely.
+Testnets are free and for testing smrt contrats.
+Mainnet cost money and are considered "live".

FAUCET
+Is an application that gives us free tokens, 
like free test Rinkeby Ethereum.

TEST NETWORKS
+Rinkeby - get testing ethereum 

BLOCK EXPLORER
+An application that allows us to "view" ransaction that happen on a blockchain.{ETHERSCAN}

GAS
+Gas ia a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses 
the more "gas" you have to pay for.
+Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a "gas fee" to node operators.
+The amount of "gas" used and how much you pay depends on how "computationally
expensive" your transaction is.
+Sending ETH to 1 address would be "cheaper" than sending ETH to 1,000 address.

+Gas: Measure of computation use
+Gas Price: How much it costs per unit of gas.
+Gas Limit: Max amount of gas in a transaction.
+Transaction Fee: Gas Used * Gas Praice
i.e. 21,000gas*1GWEI per gas = 21,000 GWEI

+Gas Price is based off the "demand" of the blockchain.
+The more people wants to make transactions, the higher the gas price, and therefore 
the higher the transaction fees.{YOU CAN CHECK ON ETH GAS STATION}

HASH
+A unique fixed length string,meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by 
placing said data.They are created by placing some data into a "hash function".
+Ethereum uses Keccak256 for its hashing algorithm.

HASH ALGORITHM 
+A function that computes data into a unique hash.

               |
               |
BLOCK
+A list of transactions mined together.
+Block consist of data and nonce which combine and give a hash value.
+Every hash value starts with 0000 (it was a struggle for developers to find a nonce value
 for for making hash value start with 0000).

 BLOCHAIN FORMATION 
 +Many blocks combine and make blockchain.
 +Genesis Block- The first block in a bloackchain.(which has previous block value as all 0).

 DECENTRALIZED(Peer to peer transaction)
 +Having no single point of authority.

 MINING
 +The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem".
 +In our example, the "problem" was to find a hash that starts with four zeros.
 +Nodes get paid for mining blocks.

Basic Termonology--

+NODE - A single instance in a decentralized network.

+NONCE - A "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem. It's also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.

+Private Key - Only known to the key holder, it's used to "sign" transactions.

+Public Key - Is derived from your private key.Anyone can "see" it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from you.

+Signing a transaction - A "one way" process. Someone with a private key signs a transaction by their private key being hashed with their transaction data.
Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key.

HOW IS ADDRESS CREATED
+To get address in ethereum allows they do is take public key that we created with ur private key hash is using that same algorithm Ethereum hashing algorithm and then take the last 20 bits.
