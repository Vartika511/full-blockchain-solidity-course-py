INTRODUCTION 
+Bitcoin was the firs one to take blockchain mainstream.
+Bitcoin is like a digital gold.
+Etereum allows for smart contracts.
+Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts.
+Hybrid Smart Contracts combine on-chain and off chain components.


Features of blockchain
+Decentralized
+Transparency and Flexibility
+Speed and Efficiency
+Security and Immutability
+Removal of Counterparty Risk
+Trust minimized agreements

DAOs [Decentralized autonomous organizations]
+The backbone of a DAO is its smart contract. 
+The contract defines the rules of the organisation and holds the group's treasury. 
+Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. 

META MASK
+Create a Meta Mask Wallet.
+Save your wallet Secret Code safely.
+Testnets are free and for testing smrt contrats.
+Mainnet cost money and are considered "live".

FAUCET
+Is an application that gives us free tokens, 
like free test Rinkeby Ethereum.

TEST NETWORKS
+Rinkeby - get testing ethereum 

BLOCK EXPLORER
+An application that allows us to "view" ransaction that happen on a blockchain.{ETHERSCAN}

GAS
+Gas ia a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses 
the more "gas" you have to pay for.
+Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a "gas fee" to node operators.
+The amount of "gas" used and how much you pay depends on how "computationally
expensive" your transaction is.
+Sending ETH to 1 address would be "cheaper" than sending ETH to 1,000 address.

+Gas: Measure of computation use
+Gas Price: How much it costs per unit of gas.
+Gas Limit: Max amount of gas in a transaction.
+Transaction Fee: Gas Used * Gas Praice
i.e. 21,000gas*1GWEI per gas = 21,000 GWEI

+Gas Price is based off the "demand" of the blockchain.
+The more people wants to make transactions, the higher the gas price, and therefore 
the higher the transaction fees.{YOU CAN CHECK ON ETH GAS STATION}

HASH
+A unique fixed length string,meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by 
placing said data.They are created by placing some data into a "hash function".
+Ethereum uses Keccak256 for its hashing algorithm.

BLOCK
+Block consist of data and nonce which combine and give a hash value.
+Every hash value starts with 0000 (it was a struggle for developers to find a nonce value
 for for making hash value start with 0000).

 BLOCHAIN FORMATION 
 +Many blocks combine and make blockchain.
 +Genesis Block- The first block in a bloackchain.(which has previous block value as all 0).
